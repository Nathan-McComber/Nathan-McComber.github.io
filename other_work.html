        <p>Here is some of my non-UX-specific work. It consists mainly of <em>graphic design work</em>, though other types of
            work could be added in the future.</p>

                        <h2>Pangolin Trafficking Infographic</h2>
                        <p>A digital infographic spreading awareness about the trafficking and mistreatment of pangolins.
                            It was intended to be viewed on the web, and all assets were created by me.

                <h2>Ice Cream Parlor Branding</h2>
                <p>I designed a logo for an ice cream parlor called "Moonlight Creamery." I also made additional branding materials such as 
                    a business card, a letterhead, and a menu. This project was conducted without prompting from the 
                    owners of "Moonlight Creamery", and they do not use the branding materials that I designed.

                <h2>Cardboard Ghost Tutorial</h2>
                <p>A short and simple tutorial for making a cardboard ghost. It was intended to be viewed on 
                    Instagram, so some of the slides "bleed" into each other. All of the photographs were taken by me.
