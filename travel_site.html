            <h1>Programming an Informative Travel Website</h1>
            <p>
                Most websites provide some type of information to users. Travel websites in particular combine both visual 
               and textual information to entice users into visiting different places. As part of a class project, I was 
               tasked with developing a travel website for a location of my choosing. I chose the 1000 Islands as my location 
               and had full control of the website's content and design. I hand-coded the site  with <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
               PHP</strong> and did not use frameworks, libraries, or vibe coding. 
            </p>

                <span class="italics">*The website is hosted on a private RIT server, so I cannot link to it.*</span>

        <section>
            <h2 id="ideate">Define and Ideate</h2>
            <p>
                Before writing up the content for the site, I needed to have an idea of what I wanted the site to have. I'm 
                familiar with the 1000 Islands area, so I began by writing down activities that I was familiar with on paper. 
                Then, I selected the most interesting/enticing activities and categorized them. Using those categories, I made 
                this site map:
            </p>

            <img src="imgs/sitemap.png" alt="Simple map of the travel website. Shows 'Home/Overview', 'Places to Visit', 'Places to Eat', 
            'Things to Do', and 'References' as key pages.">

            <p>
                After deciding on what pages the site should have, I brainstormed ideas for what each page should
                include and created this content model:
            </p>

            <img src="imgs/content_model.png" alt="Content model of the website.">

            <p>
                I also wanted to establish a style for the site before I began building it. To establish a style, I 
                experimented in Figma and made a basic mockup of how a page should look.
            </p>

            <img src="imgs/travel_site_mockup.png" alt="Basic mockup of the travel website.">

            <p>The mockup helped me identify and make rules for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Color Usage</li>
                <li>Typefaces + Type Hierarchy</li>
                <li>General Page Layout</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!--Write content and html-->
        <section>
            <h2 id="write">Write Content and Implement HTML</h2>
            <p>
                The first step I took in building the site was <strong>writing the content</strong> and <strong>finding images to use</strong>. I kept 
                track of the source for each image and gave credit next to the image and on a separate “References” page. 
                I authored the HTML as I was writing the content, which saved a significant amount of time. Things I kept in 
                mind as a wrote the markup were:
            </p>

            <div class="flexbox-3x">
                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Using Semantic Tags</em>
                    <p>&lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; instead of generic divs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Using Alt Text for Images</em>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Structuring Sections Consistently</em>
                    <p>Using the same class names and same number/structure of divs in each &lt;section&gt;. This made writing the 
                    site's CSS significantly easier.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!--Implement CSS-->
        <section>
            <h2 id="css">Implement CSS</h2>
            <p>
                When I began writing the CSS for the website I focused on the desktop view. I worked from top to bottom; 
                styling the header, then the page's main content, and finally the footer. Once I established the site's desktop 
                view, I added 4 breakpoints with <strong>media queries</strong> to make the page responsive and fit on mobile devices.  
            </p>

            <div class="flexbox-2x">
                <div class="img-card">
                    <h3>Desktop/Wide View</h3>
                    <img class="card-image" src="imgs/wide_view.png" alt="Desktop view of the travel website">
                </div>

                <div class="img-card">
                    <h3>Mobile/Narrow View</h3>
                    <img src="imgs/narrow_view.png" alt="Mobile view of travel website">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                For the mobile view, I stacked the website's navigation into a column because I did not have the time to 
                implement a hamburger menu. However, I would use a hamburger menu in the future since it would take up less 
                space and put more emphasis on the site's content. Additionally, it would allow more navigation items to be 
                added without pushing the content further down the page. 
            </p>

            <p>Some things I did that made writing the CSS easier were:</p>

            <div class="flexbox-3x">
                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Using Variables for Colors</em>
                    <p>Made changing the color of multiple elements very easy. It also prevented the need for memorizing or copy/pasting hex color values.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Using Relative Units </em>
                    <p>Made the site somewhat responsive even without media queries.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Going by Multiples of 8 for Fixed Units </em>
                    <p>Made it easier to decide on what values to use since it narrowed down the number of possible options.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!--Implement Backend-->
        <section>
            <h2 id="php">Implement Backend</h2>
            <p>The backend was written in <strong>PHP</strong> and it used a <strong>mySQL database</strong> to add more functionality to the website. 
                The main changes I made during this step were:
            </p>

            <div class="flexbox-3x">
                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Using a Database to Store the Site's Content </em>
                    <p>Instead of using HTML files to hold the content, I pulled the content from a mySQL database and displayed it using PHP.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Eliminating Reused HTML</em>
                    <p>I made PHP files for sections of HTML that were used on every page (e.g., header, footer), which allowed me to put those sections of HTML wherever I needed to.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Adding a Review Section</em>
                    <p>Users can leave a review of their experience at the 1000 Islands and see other traveler's reviews. The reviews are sent to and pulled from the mySQL database.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <br>

            <div class="flexbox-2x">
                <div class="img-card">

                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!--javascript-->
        <section>
            <h2 id="js">Add more Interactivity with JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                The website was mostly finished at this point, but the “Gallery” section on each page was lacking. The main issue 
               was that all of the images were shown at once with equal emphasis on each one. There was <strong>no focal point</strong> for the 
               user, so users' eyes could easily skip past the images without looking at them. To fix this, only one image was 
               displayed at a time and users could manually flip between them with arrow buttons.  This made the images larger 
               and <strong>placed the focus on only one thing at a time</strong>. 
            </p>

            <div class="flexbox-2x">
                <div class="img-card">
                    <h3>Old Gallery</h3>
                    <img src="imgs/old_gallery.png" alt="Old Gallery - images are all shown at once.">
                </div>

                <div class="img-card">
                    <h3>New Gallery</h3>
                    <img src="imgs/new_gallery.png" alt="New Gallery - images are shown at once and can be switched between using arrows.">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I also programmed a feature that allows users to see a larger version of a “Gallery” image when they click on it. The large image could then be dismissed by clicking anywhere.
                This feature is showcased below:

            <h2>Project Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                The travel website does a good job of showing users fun locations, activities, and attractions at the 1000 
                Islands. However, I think that including information about hotels and transportation would be necessary in 
                future versions of this site. Including that information would allow users to plan their visit to the 1000 
                Islands rather than just giving them ideas of what to do. 
            </p>

            <p>My main takeaways for this project are:</p>
            <div class="flexbox-2x">
                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>You should make a plan for your code before you begin programming.</em>
                    <p>I had a plan for my site's content and design but no plans for my code. As a result, changing 
                       one file usually meant that I had to change other files too.  For example, when I made a change in the 
                       JavaScript file that controls the gallery, I sometimes had to change the gallery PHP file. Specifically, 
                       I had to edit the &lt;figure&gt; tags that contained the gallery's images.</p>
                </div>

                 <div class="text-card">
                    <em>You should have a good idea of what makes your design successful.</em>
                    <p>
                        As I developed the website, I had to make tradeoffs between ideal design and ease of implementation. 
                       Understanding what made my design successful allowed me to make tradeoffs without compromising the 
                       effectiveness of the final website. For example, I sacrificed control over kerning and tracking to make 
                       development easier, but did not sacrifice text hierarchy since it's essential to the website's 
                       readability.
