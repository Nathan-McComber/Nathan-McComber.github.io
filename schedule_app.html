            <!--Overview Text-->
            <p>An introductory UX design class challenged teams of students to create an app or service that
                eases a person's transition from high school to college. There was no prescribed app type, 
                so user research was a key part of the process.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Formative Research</h2>
            <p>We decided to create a <em>survey</em> to reach as many people as possible. It was distributed via 
                social media groups that are primarily used by RIT students, thus ensuring that we would reach 
                our desired population.</p>

            <p>Every person in the group came up with questions and we reviewed all of them together.
                 I specifically came up with questions in the <em>social life, academics, and responsibilities</em> 
                 categories.</p>

            <p>We created 4 user profiles based on our survey data. They gave us direction and

        </section>

        <!--SOLUTION---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
        <section>
            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>We decided to prototype a <em>scheduling app</em> to help new students keep track of their busy lives.
                 To help identify key features of the app 4 <em>personas</em> were created 
                 (<a class="open-gallery" href="javascript: openGallery('imgs/galleries/schedule_persona_', 2);">I made 2</a>). We divided the features between ourselves and I took on designing the following features:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="bigger-text">Entering a Consistent/Permanent Schedule</li>
                <li class="bigger-text">Adding Events and Tasks to the Schedule</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Assessing mockups-->
            <h3>Assessing the Mockups</h3>
            <p>After creating our mockups, we performed a <em>heuristic evaluation</em> and determined changes 
                that should be made for the final app. The main heuristic my screens violated was:</p>

            <p class="issue">Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</p>
            <p class="label">Issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>users could add an event/assignment without filling in the necessary information</li>
                <li>there was no way to prevent users from creating conflicting events</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Maybe not h4?--><p class="label">Potential Solutions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>give a prompt if information is missing</li>
                <li>indicate which fields are required</li>
                <li>notify users of conflicting events and allow them to “cancel”, “replace the event”, or “add anyway”</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!--Final Product------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
        <section>
            <h2>Final Product</h2>
            <p>The assignment instructions indicated that only 2 - 3 features should be implemented in the 
                final prototype. After discussion, we decided to implement: adding events/assignments 
                (my feature), viewing the schedule, and finding local events (classmate's features). 
                Therefore, <em>I only made high-fidelity screens for adding events/assignments</em>, not for 
                creating a consistent schedule.</p>
            
            <img class="expandable" src="imgs/schedule_app/hi_fi.png" alt="High Fidelity versions of screens for adding tasks and events. Prompts for missing information or conflicting events are also included.">

            <!--Evaluation-->
            <h3>Evaluating the Prototype</h3>
            <p>We evaluated the prototype by conducting <em>usability studies</em>. Due to time constraints, 
                only 4 studies were conducted (I conducted 2). </p>

        <!--Reflection------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
        <section>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Our prototype provided a good solution for helping students adjust to college life. 
                However, many potential users said that <em>it failed to offer anything that existing apps
                (i.e. Google Calendar) didn't already have</em>.</p>

            <p>Overall, this project really helped me <em>develop my UX research skills</em> in both
                 formative and evaluative contexts.</p>

            <p class="major-point"><span class="label">Key Takeaway:</span> 
                It's important to keep a product focused on its true value. Avoid diluting it with features already implemented in other products.</p>
