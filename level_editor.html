            <h1>Redesigning a Puzzle Game Level Editor</h1>
            <p>
                As a freshman, I took a class about programming for game development. 
                Me and 3 other students in the class were tasked with making a finished game in just one semester.  
                We developed a puzzle game, and I created a level editor for our level designer using Windows Forms tools in 
                Visual Studio. However, I pivoted from game development to UX design after freshman year and have learned a lot 
                more about user interface design.  As a result, I wanted to redesign the level editor as a personal project. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="context">Context for Game and Level Editor</h2>
            <p>
                The game we developed is titled <span class="italics">Topping Tumble</span>. It's a puzzle game where players place blocks, 
                springs, and other items to guide pizza toppings from a fridge to an oven.
                Players have a limited amount of currency to spend on items for each level, 
                and not every item can be used in every level.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game can be downloaded <a href="https://jeremykdev.itch.io/topping-tumble">here</a>.

            </figure>
    
            <p>
                The editor I made aimed to make the level designer's job easier by providing a graphical 
               representation of the level they're working on. It has the following features:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Adding/Removing Level Elements (walls, knives, buttons)</li>
                <li>Modifying the amount of currency the player has</li>
                <li>Modifying the number of toppings that come from the fridge</li>
                <li>Specifying which items can be placed by the player</li>
                <li>Saving a level to import into the game</li>
                <li>Loading a level to modify it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To assess the pros and cons of my initial design, I stepped through the workflow
                of making a level while using the editor. I then applied Nielsen Norman's 10 Usability Heuristics to the 
                experience that I had making the level.

            <p>
                Before jumping straight into making a digital mockup for the level editor, I spent some time sketching 
                out ideas on paper. I usually start with sketching because it allows me to try out multiple ideas without 
                committing to one. The lack of commitment encourages me to explore more solutions and usually results in a 
                better design overall.

            <p>
                I took the sketches that I made and refined them into a “final” Level Editor by using the Windows Forms
                tools in Visual Studio. While I would normally use a tool like Figma to make a design mockup, I decided 
                to use Visual Studio's Windows Forms tools to keep within the constraints of the original project.

            <h2>Project Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                The new level editor fixes several issues that the original design had. It shows users all of the actions
                they can perform on one screen and makes the outcome of those actions obvious. It also provides hints with
                tooltips and prevents mistakes with warning dialogs.
            </p>
            
            <p>Redesigning the old level editor helped me understand that:</p>

            <div class="flexbox-2x">
                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Designs can always be improved.</em>
                    <p>
                        When I initially designed the level editor, I thought that it was good enough. 
                        However, I found that many things needed to be changed after I assessed it for flaws. 
                        This highlights the importance of reviewing designs, since the first iteration will almost always 
                        have room for improvement.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Inputs should be obvious and have a clear purpose.</em>
                    <p>
                        In my initial design for the level editor, users had to click on an icon of a tile to change 
                        its properties. It did not look like the icon was a button, and even if it was, the outcome of 
                        clicking on the button would be unclear. This was a major usability issue and was one of the main 
                        things I needed to change in my redesign.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <em>Workflow steps should be kept in mind while designing.</em>
                    <p>
                        I worked through the process of making a level to find problems in my initial editor design. 
                        If I had thought about the steps of making a level when I was originally designing the editor, 
                        I could have avoided some of the flaws I made in its design.
