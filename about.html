        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I'm a 3rd year UX Design student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It took me a while to decide on 
            UX Design as an area of study, but some key things that drew me to UX Design are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>I enjoy being <strong>creative</strong></li>

            <li>I want to <strong>help people</strong> and actually affect their lives</li>

            <li>I enjoy working on things that people <strong>interact</strong> with</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Journey to UX Design</h2>

        <p>
            My love for being creative started when I was around 3 or 4 years old. At that age, LEGOs were my life and 
            I made original builds with them every day. If there was a toy that I wanted but didn't have, I would build 
            my own LEGO version of it. Building with LEGOs allowed me to turn ideas into physical objects and helped me 
            to expand my imaginative capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, at around the age of 6, I played <span class="italics">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</span>.
            It opened up a whole new world of possibilities to me, and I felt that the game had a living, breathing world 
            inside of it. The <strong>experience</strong> and <strong>feelings</strong> the game gave me stuck with me, and I 
            realized that being able to interact with a product could make it much more impactful. 
        </p>

        <p>
            From that point forward, I thought that I wanted to get into game development. I took coding classes and 
            followed YouTube tutorials in an attempt to make my own game. I even went as far as enrolling into the 
            Game Design and Development program at the Rochester Institute of Technology. However, I soon realized that
            game development was not what I wanted to do. I wasn't interested in algorithms, physics, or graphics rendering, 
            I was interested in game mechanics, level design choices, and artistic decisions. Essentially, I was interested 
            in the aspects of game development that <strong>delivered an experience to the player</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I then pivoted to UX Design and strove to learn about how to provide experiences through apps and products.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Interests</h2>

        <p>
            When I'm not doing UX Design, I enjoy drawing, writing, reading, and playing the occasional video game. While I haven't 
            had any formal art education, I love sketching and have taught myself through YouTube videos and How-to-Draw books.
            Typically, I enjoy drawing creatures and writing up backstories/lore for them. I also do a little 
            bit of character design and want to push myself by drawing landscapes and architecture. My current art goals are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Learn to draw with a variety of pencil hardnesses</li>
            <li>Add color to my art with watercolor paints</li>
            <li>Get comfortable with drawing animals/people in an environment (not just floating in space)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I also like writing my own stories and am currently handwriting a small fantasy story in a little notebook. In the future, I hope 
            to draw scenes from the story or use stop motion animation to bring the tale to life.
        </p>
