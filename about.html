        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I'm a 3rd year UX Design student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It took me a while to decide on 
            UX Design as an area of study, but some key things that drew me to UX Design are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>I enjoy being <strong>creative</strong></li>

            <li>I want to <strong>help people</strong> and actually affect their lives</li>

            <li>I enjoy working on things that people <strong>interact</strong> with</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Journey to UX Design</h2>

        <p>
            I've loved creating things for as long as I can remember, and I've enjoyed experiencing stories through video 
            games for most of my life. From a young age I intended to be a game developer, and I even enrolled into the 
            Game Design and Development program at the Rochester Institute of Technology. However, I soon realized that
            game development itself was not what I wanted to do. I wasn't super interested in algorithms, physics, or graphics rendering, 
            I was interested in game mechanics, level design choices, and artistic decisions. Essentially, I was interested 
            in the aspects of game development that <strong>delivered a positive experience to the player</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            After coming to this realization, I pivoted to UX Design and have strove to learn about providing positive experiences through apps and products ever since.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Interests</h2>

        <p>
            When I'm not doing UX Design, I enjoy drawing, writing, reading, and playing the occasional video game. While I haven't 
            had any formal art education, I love sketching and have taught myself through YouTube videos and How-to-Draw books.
            Typically, I enjoy drawing creatures and writing up backstories/lore for them. I also do a little 
            bit of character design and want to push myself by drawing landscapes and architecture. My current art goals are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Learn to draw with a variety of pencil hardnesses</li>
            <li>Add color to my art with watercolor paints</li>
            <li>Get comfortable with drawing animals/people in an environment (not just floating in space)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I also like writing my own stories and am currently handwriting a small fantasy story in a little notebook. In the future, I hope 
            to draw scenes from the story or use stop motion animation to bring the tale to life.
        </p>
